NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::DynamicExpiry - per-session custom expiry
    times

SYNOPSIS
        # put Session::DynamicExpiry in your use Catalyst line
        
    if ($c->req->param('remember') { 
          $c->session_time_to_live( 604800 ) # expire in one week.
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to expire session cookies indvidually per
    session.

    If the "session_time_to_live" field is defined it will set expiry to
    that many seconds into the future. Note that the session cookie is set
    on every request, so a expiry of one week will stay as long as the user
    visits the site at least once a week.

    Once ttl has been set for a session the ttl will be stored in the
    "__time_to_live" key within the session data itself, and reused for
    subsequent request, so you only need to set this once per session (not
    once per request).

    This is unlike the ttl option in the config in that it allows different
    sessions to have different times, to implement features like "remember
    me" checkboxes.

METHODS
  session_time_to_live $ttl
    To set the TTL for this session use this method.

OVERRIDDEN METHODS
  calculate_initial_session_expires
  calculate_extended_session_expires
    Overridden to implement dynamic expiry functionality.
